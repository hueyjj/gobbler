Examples of such investigations include: genetic pathway interpretation of multivariate high-throughput datasets; discovery of mutations in whole-genome sequence; identifications and quantification of gene isoforms, alleles, and copy number variants; and machine-learning tools to predict clinical outcomes. Students present their own research, host journal clubs, and attend lectures and teleconferences to learn about research conducted by national and international projects.

            "description": "Surveys tactical, structural, contextual, and other methods to enhance creativity and innovation in the design of games and other interactive media. Investigates strategies for creativity and innovation drawn from diverse fields, including interactive affordances, narrative and poetics, biology, contextual inquiry, and design research. To innovate in a field of fixed genres is challenging: the allure of modeling exemplars is strong. Although imitation can be successful in the marketplace, the most creative action occurs on the leading edge of change. Innovation benefits from strategies and methods that are directly aimed at exploring new perspectives and structures to learn through the process of discovery. (Formerly Computer Science 177.)",
